## 7. Development Steps  

### 7.1. Initial Setup  
1. Create project repository and set up version control (GitHub or GitLab).  
2. Set up Docker environment:  
   - Dockerfile for backend (Python FastAPI)  
   - Dockerfile for frontend (React + Vite)  
   - PostgreSQL service setup  
   - docker-compose.yml connecting all services  

### 7.2. Backend Development  
1. Project initialization with Poetry and Alembic.  
2. Database schema design and migrations.  
3. User authentication (password + Google OAuth).  
4. Develop core API endpoints:  
   - User registration and login  
   - Thesis submission endpoints  
   - Thesis status management endpoints  
   - Commenting endpoints  
   - Event and deadline endpoints  
5. Email notification service integration.  
6. Testing: Unit and integration tests for backend API.  

### 7.3. Frontend Development
